# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is Quiz Game using [Create React App].
When the game begins, the player is presented with ten questions, one by one, from a
pool of more than ten questions. The questions are to be presented in a random
order, but the player should not receive the same question twice until all the
other questions has been answered. A question can have a text or an image, and
four alternative answers. 

Only one of the answers is correct.

The player has 15 seconds to answer each question. The remaining time should
be visible to the player. When the time is up for a question, that question is
considered unanswered. The player has two lifelines, one called “50/50” that
removes two incorrect answers, and one called “+10 s” that gives the player
ten extra seconds for the current question. Each lifeline can only be used once
during a game.
